# In The Moonlight

## M8: Hakuna Fermata

This a the song I made in Sonic Pi. It is meant to invoke relaxing emotions, while still being dynamic and interesting to listen to. The song is titled "Moonlight".

I tried to take advantage of some of Sonic Pi's organizational features, such as functions, to make my song a bit easier to deal with. I also relied heavily On the thread, and intern, cues and thinking, to keep everything in time. This could be tricky to deal with sometimes. For example, if I wanted to sleep for four beats and then have the next note play on a certain cue, writing "sleep 4" might result in the thread missing that cue, and in my case, playing a full beat later than it was supposed to. My in elegant solution to this was to sleep for 3.9 beats instead of four.
